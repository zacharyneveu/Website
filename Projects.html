				<h2>
					Electric Cello
				</h2>
				I've always played the cello, and the biggest issue I've always had is volume: on stage, a single cello is too quiet, in an apartment, a single cello is too loud.  To combat this, I built my own electric cello.  It is a 23 pound beast, hewn from a single block of cherry wood almost twenty inches across and three inches thick.  I designed and carved the entire cello by hand.  It uses a piezoelectric transducer under the bridge to pick up the sound, as well as a standard cello end pin, pegs, and strings.  The cello is fun to play, and sounds great with a little DSP.

				<h2>
					Nautilus Speakers
				</h2>
				After looking at the Nautilus speakers by Bowers and Wilkins, I decided I wanted a pair, and I didn’t have the $60,000 to buy a pair from them.  With a budget about a thousand times smaller than that, I have set out to build my own pair.  They are made from birch plywood frames with heat molded plastic shells.  The speaker diaphragm will be six inches in diameter on each, and the first prototypes will run at ten watts a piece.
After a few months of work the speaker is finished! it doesn’t look quite like the original design but by and large I am really excited about how it came out! eight watts of crystal clear, lifelike sound.

				<h3>
					Custom Midi and Audio Controller
				</h3>
				The goal of this project is to create an instrument with both audio and visual feedback.  The project consists of a custom built midi controller paired with Traktor music software and vvvv visuals.  I built this as my senior project at the Maine Coast Waldorf School.  It all fits inside of a rugged diamond plate toolbox and is equipped with its own 100 watt sound system, and ASIO sound card for simple one chord plug and play functionality.  The controls are all metal, and the control surface is self lit eliminating the need for a lamp.

					Photo Realistic Rendering
				</h2>
				A year or two ago I was browsing through an issue of Popular Science and was astounded by how realistic some of the renderings of future products were.  I then set out to make some renderings of my own.  The following images were created by modeling in 3D using 3DS Max (by Autodesk), and rendered using both Iray and Mental Ray rendering engines.  Rendering at high resolution took a surprisingly long amount of time using a cluster of two laptops and an older desktop tower!

				<h2>
					Smart Home Location Tracker
				</h2>
				In our house, the family group-text used to get filled up with endless messages asking where everyone was.  To get rid of this constant annoyance, I developed a Raspberry Pi powered device which which uses IFTTT and Google Drive to determine whether each member of the family is at "Home" "School" "Work" "Away" or a number of other places based on the location of their phone.  The device sits on the kitchen table, and has eliminated the endless texts in the family chat.  Future plans for the device include building a more rugged enclosure, and swapping the Raspberry Pi 3 with a more cost-effective processing unit.

				<h2>
					Customizing Vim
				</h2>
				<h3>
					Making a Good Editor Great
				</h3>

				Out of the box, Vim has some cool features, but the true beauty of this editor lies in the ability to customize it.  With a little modification, Vim can be used to write code in all different languages faster, with fewer bugs than other mainstream editors such as Visual Studio and Dev C++.  Customizing Vim takes a fair amount of fiddling, so to save you time, here is a list of essential modifications and how to implement them in Vim.

				<h3>
					VIMRC
				</h3>

				The first critical step to customizing Vim is creating a vimrc file.  This is simply a file located in Vim's installation directory named <i> .vimrc </i>.  This file can store data from custom key mappings to how code is indented and syntax is highlighted so it is essential to get a simple vimrc up and running.  Within the vimrc, there are a few key kinds of settings that can be configured to improve workflow significantly.

				<h3>
					Key Mappings
				</h3>

				There are many combinations of letters that are simply never placed next to each other while typing.  Why not use these combinations to perform other functions?  Vim offers the ability to map the functions of keys separately for both normal and insert modes.  In your vimrc, simply add a line for each mapping in the form of the following commands.
				<!--
				   - <img src="Images/keymap.jpg">
				   -->
				<pre>
					<code class="vim">
"Save Commands
inoremap jk <esc>:w<C-CR>
inoremap JK <esc>:w<C-CR>
nmap fd :w<enter>

"Git commands
nmap gpull :!git pull origin
nmap gpush :!git push origin
nmap gcom :!git commit -m "
nmap gadd :!git add *.cpp *.h <enter>
nmap gstat :!git status <enter>
nmap gbranch :!git branch
					</code>
				</pre>

				<h3>
					Compile Shortcuts
				</h3>

				Using key mapping, it is possible to execute a different command based on what file type is being edited. This is very useful, for example, because it allows you to set a single key to compile and run your code in every language you write in.  I have this function mapped to f11 on my keyboard.
				<!--
				   - <img src="Images/compile.jpg">
				   -->
				<pre>
					<code class="vim">
"Map &lt;F11> to compile commands in different languages"
autocmd FileType c map &lt;buffer> &lt;F11> :!gcc % && a.exe &lt;CR>
autocmd FileType cpp map &lt;buffer> &lt;F11> :!g++ % && a.exe &lt;CR>
autocmd FileType tex map &lt;buffer> &lt;F11> :!pdflatex % &lt;CR>
autocmd FileType verilog map &lt;buffer> &lt;F11> :!iverilog -o a % && vvp a
autocmd FileType html,htm map &lt;buffer> &lt;F11> :! start %&lt;CR>
autocmd FileType mips map &lt;buffer> &lt;F11> :!java -jar C:\Users\Zachary\Desktop\Mars4_5.jar %&lt;CR>
					</code>
				</pre>

				<h3>
					Plugins
				</h3>

				Plugins can extend the uses for Vim far beyond what can be done easily in your vimrc.  To install plugins in Vim, it is recommended that you fist install a plugin manager.  I use Pathogen, I've heard Vundle is also good.  Once you have this installed, follow the directions that came with it for installing plugins.  The functions of plugins can vary wildly.  I use plugins for everything from eliminating white extra whitespace to implementing autocomplete in the style of xcode.  Here is a list of some of the plugins I find helpful.

				<h4>
					Gruvbox and Solarized
				</h4>
				These simple plugins provide colorschemes for Vim that are easy on the eyes, yet provide ample contrast when necessary.  Both plugins have day and night modes.

				<h4>
					UltiSnips
				</h4>
				This handy plugin allows you to create "snippets" of code which can be inserted on the fly by typing a few letters and pressing the trigger key (which I have set to tab).  I use this plugin to insert skeletons for loops, conditional statements, html tags, and much more.  I find it eliminates careless errors, and forces consistent style in my code as well as saving me time.

				<h4>
					YouCompleteMe
				</h4>
				This plugin must be compiled by the user before use, and requires a fair amount of dependencies, however it provides fast, accurate completion.  YouCompleteMe learns your variable names within a file, as well as common c-family syntax.  This plugin also uses clang to check your code for errors which it displays on the status bar and with arrows in the margin.

				<h4> NerdTree and CtrlP </h4>
				These two plugins are essentially file managers for within Vim.  NerdTree offers a standard file-tree system which opens at the left side of the Vim window and has keyboard shortcuts to move through the tree and open the file under the cursor.  CtrlP opens a single line at the bottom of the screen and will fuzzy search for the file name entered.  I have keys mapped to open both NerdTree and CtrlP in the current directory I'm working in as I find they each have strengths.  NerdTree is great if I forget what a file is called, but CtrlP is a quick way to open a file that may be many layers down in my filesystem.

				<h4> Nerdcommenter </h4>
				this plugin offers a simple solution for commenting and uncommenting blocks while coding.  it provides a few different styles of commenting, and with two or three key presses can comment, uncomment or toggle comments for a selected block of code.  It is very simple, but crucial, and works in most common languages.
